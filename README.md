# Play CLRS with `GoLang`

This repository is trying to focus on the implementation of the data structures and algorithms described in *Introduction to Algorithms* with a modern programming language: `GoLang`. For achieving this goal, more efforts are needed, including:

1. Proof (think above the code)
2. Elaborate comments
3. Test/Benchmark
